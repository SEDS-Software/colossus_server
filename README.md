# colossus_server

Put these files where the gantner datalogger is running.  It reads the files that are writing info every second.

Then at any point you can go to the ip address of the thinkpad and port 5000 and get all the data.


# run
python main.py to actually make the server run on port 5000

java random to generate test files
